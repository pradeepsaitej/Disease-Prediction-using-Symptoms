# Disease Prediction from Symptoms

This project aims to predict diseases based on symptoms using machine learning algorithms. The following algorithms have been explored in the code:

1. Naive Bayes
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. Logistic Regression

## Overview

The main objective of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to predict diseases based on symptoms provided as input. The implemented algorithms have been chosen for their effectiveness in classification tasks, and their performance is compared to identify the most suitable model for the given problem.
